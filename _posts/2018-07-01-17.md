Pour a litre of finding yourself, a teaspoon of friendship or home drama, some societal pressure in while adding the cherry that is puberty on top and you will get the ingredients to a typical teenager’s day. Mix them all up and you get a visual representation of most 13 to 19 year-olds’ inner psyche – a mess.

Teenage years are often one of the most confusing years in an individual’s life so it is no wonder that emotions and feelings are likely to manifest strongly during this time, resulting in teen angst.  According to Oxford English Dictionary, angst can be defined as “a feeling of anxiety about your life or situation”. The late psychologist William G. Perry, a Harvard professor who studied teenage behaviour, theorised that adolescence is the time at which most individuals will start to question previous beliefs and authority figures. This, coupled with hormonal changes and expectations placed on them, is what causes teenagers to develop teen angst. However, his study also draws the line between teen angst and depression, a mental illness that has recently become synonymous with teen angst due to the similarities.

While teen angst is a very real phenomenon amongst teens, clinical depression is much more severe. It is a mood disorder that can only be diagnosed by a psychiatrist and, in most cases, has to be constantly treated with medication. This is because the intensity of clinical depression is not due to everyday stress but from the lack of a chemical known as serotonin (also known as the “happy” chemical) in an individual’s brain. The lack of this chemical may be due to high stress or trauma but there is no real relation between the two.

Armed with this knowledge, it may seem like the two are separate entities but, with the rise in self-diagnosis and social media, the lines have become blurred to the public. In a poll conducted for this article, with over a hundred respondents, it is recorded that 88% of respondents felt like they knew the difference between depression and teen angst. However when given scenarios and asked to identify which was teen angst or depression, 67% answered with unsure.

When asked about how the line between the two has begun to blur, many blame social media and trends. In our present generation, social media aids in the spread of trends and helps to bring the world closer together. Unfortunately, this also creates a herd-like mentality where youths are constantly chasing after the next new trend. And, somehow, mental illnesses have become a trend. While mental illnesses are universally thought of as a negative, youths often receive concerned comments both online and in real life. This sometimes leads to youths misdiagnosing themselves.  Of course, this is not the only reason.

Similar to how parents sometimes diagnose their children with WebMD, teens have also started to diagnose themselves with mental illnesses based on symptoms that they experience and read about instead of going to a proper medical facility to get themselves checked. This often causes teens with no ill-will towards the mental health community to mistake their own teen angst for depression.

Unlike cancer or other physical ailments, mental illness can only be physically detected using MRI scans. However, these scans are expensive and can be difficult for those with claustrophobia or radiation poisoning, so they are not commonly conducted. Unfortunately, that lack of on-paper evidence can cause many to doubt the existence and severity of mental illnesses, referring to it as ‘in your own head’. It certainly does not help when more and more teens start to claim that they may also have this illness without a doctor’s diagnosis.
